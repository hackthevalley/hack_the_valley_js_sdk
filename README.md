## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to this repository, there isn't really any style guidelines, once you read through the codebase everything should be very self-explanatory.

Note that we use Flow to do static type checking, you can manually run `npm test` to check types. There is also a pre-commit hook where we automatically checks the typing for you.
